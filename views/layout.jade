      Stylesheets and Preprocessors
      ==============================

      You can always bring in CSS files manually with `<link>` tags, or asynchronously
      using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can take advantage
      of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

      By default, stylesheets from your `assets/styles` folder are included
      here automatically (between STYLES and STYLES END). Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less)
      are supported. In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into
      a single file.

      To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
      For example, here are a few things you could do:

        + Change the order of your CSS files
        + Import stylesheets from other directories
        + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus

    // STYLES
    link(rel="stylesheet", href="styles/importer.css")
    // STYLES END
  body
    include ./includes/header.jade
    .content
      block content
    include ./includes/footer.jade

    // TEMPLATES
    
    // TEMPLATES END

    // SCRIPTS
    script(src="js/dependencies/jquery.js")
    script(src="js/dependencies/bootstrap.js")
    // SCRIPTS END
